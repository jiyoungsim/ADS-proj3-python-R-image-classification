### Lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions and code.

Scripts needed to run main.ipynb are the following:

+ feature.R: baseline feature extraction

+ train_baseline.ipynb: train baseline model
+ test_baseline.ipynb: test baseline model
+ train_voting.ipynb: train final voting classifier

To run main--prediction.ipynb for prediction, the following were included.
+ test_baseline_2.ipyny was used instead of test_baseline.ipynb
